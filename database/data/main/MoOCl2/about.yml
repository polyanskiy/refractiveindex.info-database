ABOUT: |
    Molybdenum oxychloride (MoOCl<sub>2</sub>) is an inorganic molybdenum compound belonging to the family of transition-metal oxyhalides. Compounds of this class typically feature mixed metal–oxygen and metal–halogen bonding and often form layered or chain-like crystal structures. The presence of both oxide and chloride ligands leads to distinct electronic and optical properties compared to simple oxides or halides.<br>
    MoOCl<sub>2</sub> and related molybdenum oxychlorides have been studied primarily in the context of solid-state chemistry, coordination chemistry, and as precursors for the synthesis of other molybdenum-based materials. Due to its anisotropic bonding and potential low-dimensional structural motifs, MoOCl<sub>2</sub> may exhibit direction-dependent optical properties. Experimental data on its refractive index and absorption are limited, and reported optical constants depend on sample form, preparation method, and measurement conditions.
