ABOUT: |
    Germanium disulfide (GeS<sub>2</sub>) is a chalcogenide compound known for its wide infrared transparency and high refractive index. It crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure but is often used in its amorphous (glassy) form. GeS<sub>2</sub>-based glasses are key materials in infrared optics, especially in mid-IR applications (2–10 µm), due to their low phonon energy and favorable nonlinear optical properties. These characteristics make GeS₂ a valuable component in optical fibers, lenses, and infrared sensors. It is also studied for its role in photonics, infrared transmitting windows, and as a host material in rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers.
