ABOUT: |
    N,N-Dimethylaniline (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N, DMA) is an aromatic amine consisting of a benzene ring substituted with a dimethylamino group. It is a colorless to pale yellow oily liquid with a characteristic amine-like odor, which darkens upon exposure to air and light. Dimethylaniline is widely used as an intermediate in the production of dyes, antioxidants, and photographic chemicals. It also serves as a solvent and a reagent in organic synthesis. Due to its toxic and potentially carcinogenic properties, it should be handled with care in well-ventilated environments.

    Chemical formula:
    C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
