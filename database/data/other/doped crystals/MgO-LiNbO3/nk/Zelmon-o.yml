    21 °C. Ordinary ray (o). Congruently grown lithium niobate (CLN) doped with 5 mol. % MgO.<br>
    In the original publication, the ordinary and extraordinary Sellmeier coefficients appear to be interchanged. The coefficients are presented here with n<sub>o</sub> and n<sub>e</sub> swapped to match the measured dispersion and the known negative uniaxial behavior of MgO:LiNbO<sub>3</sub>.
CONDITIONS:
    temperature: 294
    direction: o
DATA:
  - type: formula 2
    wavelength_range: 0.4 5.0
