<h1>ProSQ-C16, C<sub>50</sub>H<sub>80</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></h1>

<p>
ProSQ-C16 is an organic squaraine dye known for its strong absorption and emission in the near-infrared region. With a molecular formula of C<sub>50</sub>H<sub>80</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, it features a squaraine core linked to long alkyl chains containing 16 carbon atoms each. These extended chains enhance the dye's solubility and film-forming properties, making it suitable for various optoelectronic applications.
</p>
<p>
ProSQ-C16 exists in two enantiomerically pure forms, (S,S)-ProSQ-C16 and (R,R)-ProSQ-C16, as well as in a racemic mixture called rac-ProSQ-C16. The enantiomerically pure forms, (S,S) and (R,R), share the same complex refractive index. However, the racemic mixture exhibits different optical properties and a different complex refractive index due to the presence of both enantiomers.
</p>
<p>
This dye is of significant interest for its chiroptical properties, such as circular dichroism and optical activity, making it valuable in studies of molecular chirality and supramolecular chemistry.
