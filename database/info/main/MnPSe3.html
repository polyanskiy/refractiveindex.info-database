<h1>Manganese phosphorus selenide, MnPSe<sub>3</sub></h1>

Manganese phosphorus selenide (MnPSe<sub>3</sub>) is a layered compound that belongs to the family of transition metal phosphorus trichalcogenides. This material is characterized by its unique combination of magnetic, electronic, and optical properties, which stem from its layered crystal structure. MnPSe<sub>3</sub> is particularly noted for its antiferromagnetic properties at low temperatures, making it an interesting candidate for spintronic applications. In terms of its electronic structure, MnPSe<sub>3</sub> exhibits semiconducting behavior with a direct bandgap, which is promising for optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors and light-emitting diodes. The study of its optical properties, including its refractive index, is crucial for understanding and utilizing light-matter interactions in this material. The refractive index of MnPSe<sub>3</sub> is vital for the design of optical components where control of light propagation and absorption is necessary. Continued research into the optical characterization of MnPSe<sub>3</sub> will enhance its potential for innovative applications in electronics and photonics.
