<h1>Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene</h1>

Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, a member of the MXene family, is a two-dimensional transition metal carbide known for its unique properties and applications. MXenes, which are derived from MAX phases (ternary carbides or nitrides), are recognized for their exceptional electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and chemical stability. Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> is synthesized by selectively etching aluminum layers from Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub> using hydrofluoric acid, resulting in a layered structure that can be easily intercalated with ions and molecules. Due to its excellent electrical conductivity and large surface area, Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> finds applications in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, its high surface reactivity makes it suitable for use in catalysis, electromagnetic interference shielding, and water purification. The material's mechanical properties, including high Young's modulus and flexibility, also make it a candidate for use in flexible electronics and sensors.
